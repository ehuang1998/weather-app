# weather-app

A weather webapp I built as part of The Odin Project series. Built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features

* Shows whatever location the user inputs and updates the DOM with current Temperature, Conditions and Windspeed.
* Uses visual crossings web API to fetch weather data from server in JSON. For the purposes of this project, it is okay to reveal the API Key.
* Allow for switching between Metric and Imperial units.

## Things I Learned
* Learned how to make API calls and efficiently generate API link.
* Improve my CSS knowledge with transistions and animations.
